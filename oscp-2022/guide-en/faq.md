# FAQ

I compiled questions that were asked the most about this guide through socials (reddit, twitter, linkedin). Let me know if you want me to answer specific questions or add some topics to this guide.

### I have one month access to the PEN-200 platform, what should I focus on ?

On limited time I recommend spending all you time on labs and walkthroughs. Ignore the course/exercises section.

### What about Buffer Overflows ?

BoF is not mandatory anymore, it was replaced by Active Directory. That being said, BOF can still be present in the exam, this is what I recommend to train for BoF: Pen-200 BOF exercises, tiberius' [BOF room on tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/room/bufferoverflowprep). And the best resource to learn from scratch is TheCyberMentor youtube course: [https://youtu.be/ncBblM920jw](https://youtu.be/ncBblM920jw)
